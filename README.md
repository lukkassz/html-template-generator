# HTML5 Template Generator

This Python script generates a basic HTML5 template based on user inputs. The generated template includes meta tags, language selection, character encoding, and optional CSS and JavaScript files.

## Usage

1. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python html_generator.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter website information such as language, title, author, description, and keywords.

3. Choose whether to include basic social media meta tags, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file.

4. The generated files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) will be saved in the same directory as the script.
